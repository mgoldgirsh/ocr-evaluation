# OCR Evaluation

This project will investigate two different versions of OCR and evaluate their performance against each other
- Segmented OCR (self-trained model)
    - Naive Segmentation: Split all cells in to (60x40) images
    - Better Segmentation: Filter out empty cells to try to get individual characters in images  

- Easy OCR (https://github.com/JaidedAI/EasyOCR)
    - Prebuilt OCR model
